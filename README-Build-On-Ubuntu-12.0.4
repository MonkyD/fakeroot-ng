How to build on Ubuntu 12.04
============================

fakeroot-ng requires g++ 4.7 or better to compile. This is not available
as stanard on Ubuntu Precise 12.04, even within backports. To compile,
bring in the Raring tool chain.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++-4.7

You do not need to update-alternatives (i.e. use the new tool chain by
default) for this package to compile.

The resultant .deb works fine on Precise without additional libraries.
