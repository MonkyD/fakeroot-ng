When building fakeroot-ng, it is recommended that the --with-memdir
configure option be used to direct the shared memory files into a directory
that resides on a tmpfs file system. On Debian systems, this is typically the
/dev/shm directory. Care must be taken, however, that this directory not reside
on a file system that is mounted with the noexec flag, or fakeroot-ng will not
be able to function properly.

This file lists bugs and limitations of fakeroot-ng. There are three lists:
SCOPE - areas that are left, on purpose, outside the scope
TODO - lists action items that are simply not yet implemented
BUGS - lists functions that are implemented, but have known limitations that
will be addressed soonish
LIMITATIONS - lists limitations either inherent to the technology, or that
are outside the scope of coverage intended in the foreseeable future.

SCOPE
- When switching users, file permissions do not mimic the real system. For
  files created as part of the fake root environment, all access is "root"
  access, regardless of the file's true permissions.

TODO
- Wider support for "old" syscalls (16 bit getuid, 32bit stat etc.)
- Multithreaded debugger
- Redirect opens of "character devices" to real device with same major/minor.
- In chroot, the actual interpreter file (ld-linux for ELF executable) is
  searched for in the real root, rather than in the chrooted jail.

BUGS
- The "wait" type syscalls are only emulated enough to allow two specific
  debuggers to run: fakeroot-ng and strace
- Poor handling of multithreaded programs - mostly solved
- Poor handling of 32 bit programs on X86_64
- Files created inside SGID directories do not inherit their gid from the
  directory.

LIMITATIONS
- Program has limited access to the fakeroot-ng controlled memory inside the
  program's address space
